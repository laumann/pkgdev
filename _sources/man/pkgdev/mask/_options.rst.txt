Positional Arguments
--------------------

:TARGET:  
        Packages matching any of these restrictions will have a mask entry in
        profiles/package.mask added for them. If no target is specified a path
        restriction is created based on the current working directory. In other
        words, if ``pkgdev mask`` is run within an ebuild's directory, all the
        ebuilds within that directory will be masked.

Base Options
------------

-h, --help       
                 Show this help message and exit. To get more
                 information see the related man page.

--debug          
                 Enable debug checks and show verbose debug output.

-q, --quiet      
                 Suppress non-error, informational messages.

-v, --verbose    
                 Increase the verbosity of various output.

--color BOOLEAN  
                 Toggle colored output support. This can be used to forcibly
                 enable color support when piping output or other sitations
                 where stdout is not a tty.

Mask Options
------------

-r [DAYS], --rites [DAYS]  
                           Mark a mask entry for last rites. This defaults to 30 days until
                           package removal but accepts an optional argument for the number of
                           days.
